12:00 < rjbs> dhoss: Okay, what do you want to know.
12:01 < dhoss> rjbs: you recommended setting up some moose attributes to handle 
               mailers.  i'm sorry but my attention was fleeting as i was 
			                  heading out the door.
							  12:01 < dhoss> Anyway, you should probably do something like use mailer and  
							                 mailer_args to build a transport as needed during BUILD
											 12:01 < rjbs> They already exist, from what I saw
											 12:01 < dhoss> 10:24 <@rjbs> and then have a _transport attr
											 12:01 < rjbs> mailer and mailer_args
											 12:01 < rjbs> yes.
